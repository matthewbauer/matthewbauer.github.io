  <title>Subjective ranking of build systems</title>
  <description><![CDATA[

<div id="outline-container-org6e664e2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6e664e2"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> My subjective ranking of build systems</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Very few of us are happy with our choices of build systems. There
are a lot out there and none feel quite right to many people. I
wanted to offer my personal opinions on build systems. Every build
system is “bad” in its own way. But some are much worse than
others.
</p>

<p>
As a maintainer for Nixpkgs, we have to deal with . I’ve avoided
build systems that are language-specific. Those build systems are
usually the only choice for your language, so ranking them will
inevitably include opinions on the language itself. So, I’ve
included in this list only language neutral build systems. In
addition, I’ve filtered out any build systems that are not included
in Nixpkgs. This perspective is going to prioritize features that
make your project easiest to package in cross-platform ways. It’s
very subjective, so I only speak for myself here.
</p>

<p>
I separate two kinds of software used for packages. One is the
“meta” build system that provides an abstract interface to create
build rules. The other is the build runner that will run the rules.
Most meta build systems support targeting multiple backends.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc7cae77" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc7cae77"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> What makes a good build system?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Some criteria I have for these build systems.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Good defaults builtin. By default, packages should support
specifying “prefix” and “destination directory”.</li>
<li>Works with widely available software. Being able to generate
Makefiles is a big bonus. Everyone has access to make - not
everyone has Ninja. This is often needed for bootstrapping.</li>
<li>Supports cross compilation concepts. A good separation between
buildtime and runtime is a must have! In addition you should be
able to set build, host, and target from the command line. This
makes things much easier for packaging and bootstrapping.</li>
<li>Detection of dependencies reuses existing solutions. Pkgconfig
provides an easy way to detect absolute directories. No need to
reinvent the wheel here.</li>
<li>The less dependencies the better! Requiring a Java or Python
runtime means it takes longer to rebuild the world. They
introduce bottlenecks where every package needs to wait for these
runtimes to be built before we can start running things in
parallel.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0908b83" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0908b83"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Ranking of meta build systems from bad to worse</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>GNU Autotools (Automake &amp; autoconf)</li>
<li>Meson</li>
<li>CMake</li>
<li>gyp</li>
<li>qmake</li>
<li>imake</li>
<li>premake</li>
</ol>

<p>
GNU Autotools comes in at the top. It has the best support for
cross compilation of any meta build system. It has been around for
a while and means that the classic “./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make
install” work. Because the configure script is just a simple bash
script, packages don’t have to depend directly on GNU Autotools at
build time. This is a big plus in bootstrapping software. I think
Meson has made a lot of progress in improving its cross
compilation support. It’s not quite there in my opinion, as it
requires you to create cross tool files instead of using command
line arguments.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org67f64c2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org67f64c2"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Ranking of build runners from bad to worse</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>GNU Make</li>
<li>Ninja</li>
<li>Bazel</li>
<li>boost.build</li>
<li>SCons</li>
</ol>

<p>
GNU Make is still the top choice in my personal opinion. It has
been around for a while, but Makefiles are widely understood and
GNU Make is included everywhere. In addition, the Makefile build
rule format is easy to parallelize. Ninja still requires Python to
build itself. This adds to the Nixpkgs bottleneck because Python
is not included in the bootstrap tools. While there are some
speedups in Ninja, they don’t appear to be significant enough to
be worth switching at this time. At the same time, Ninja is still
a perfectly good choice if you value performance over legacy
support.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org79b73bf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org79b73bf"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Conclusion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
In Nixpkgs, we have made an attempt to support whatever build
system you are using. But, some are definitely better than others.
</p>

<p>
My main goal here is to try to get software authors to think more
critically about what build system they are using. In my opinion,
it is better to use well known software over more obscure systems.
These shouldn’t be taken as a universal truth. Everyone has their
own wants and needs. But, if your build system comes in at the
bottom of this list, you might want to consider switching to
something else!

  <title>Beginner’s guide to cross compilation in Nixpkgs</title>
  <description><![CDATA[

<div id="outline-container-org840b947" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org840b947"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> What is cross compilation?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
First, compilation refers to converting human-readable source code
into computer-readable object code. Usually the computer you are
building the code <i>for</i> is the same as the computer you are running
<i>on</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. In cross compilation, however, that is not the case. We can
build code for any computer that our compiler supports!
</p>

<p>
Cross-compilation is not a new idea at all. GCC and Autoconf are
ancient tools that we use internally in Nixpkgs. But, getting those
ideas to work well with Nix’s functional dependency model has taken
years and years of work from the Nix community. We are finally to the
point where an end user can easily start cross compiling things
themselves.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgea0db89" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgea0db89"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Unstable channel</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
If you do not have Nix installed, you can install it available at
<a href="https://nixos.org/nix/">NixOS.org</a>. The rest of the guide will assume that Nix is already
installed.
</p>

<p>
Much work has gone into bringing cross compilation support to Nixpkgs.
While Nixpkgs has had some support for cross compiling for awhile,
recent changes have made cross compilation much easier and more
elegant. These changes will be required for this guide. We plan to
have a stable version of this ready for 18.09. Before that though, you
will need to use the unstable channel. Things can be built with the
unstable channel fairly easily with Nix 2.0. For instance, to build
the hello program,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable hello
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The rest of the guide will use nixos-unstable as the channel. However,
once 18.09 is released, you should be able to also use the stable
channel.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org15751cf" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org15751cf"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Building things</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
One of the important principles of cross compilation in Nixpkgs is
handling native and cross compilation identically. This means that it
should be possible to cross-compile any package in Nixpkgs with little
to no modification at all. If your derivation specifies its
dependencies correctly, Nix/Nixpkgs can figure out how to build it.
</p>

<p>
So now it’s time to show what we can do with Nixpkgs cross compilation
framework<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. I’ve compiled a short list of cross package sets
along with their corresponding attribute names.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Raspberry Pi (pkgsCross.raspberryPi)</li>
<li><code>x86_64</code> Musl (pkgsCross.musl64)</li>
<li>Android (pkgsCross.aarch64-android-prebuilt)</li>
<li>iPhone (pkgsCross.iphone64)</li>
<li>Windows (pkgsCross.mingwW64)</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, if you are familiar with Nixpkgs, you would know that if you
wanted to build Emacs for your native computer you can just run,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable pkgs.emacs
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Likewise, if you wanted to build Emacs for a Raspberry Pi, you can
just run,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable pkgsCross.raspberryPi.emacs
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The built package will be in the same ARM machine code used by the
Raspberry Pi. The important thing to notice here is that we have the
power to build in any package in Nixpkgs for any of the platforms
listed above. Of course, many of these will have issues due to not
being portable, but with time we can make both Nixpkgs &amp; the free
software world better at handling cross compilation. Any of the
software listed in ‘nix search’ should be possible to cross compile
through the pkgsCross attribute.
</p>

<p>
Some more examples of things that I have worked on,
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Windows
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable pkgsCross.mingw32.hello
$ nix run -f channel:nixos-unstable wine -c ./result/bin/hello.exe
Hello, world!
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
Android
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable <span class="org-sh-escaped-newline">\</span>
      pkgsCross.aarch64-android-prebuilt.curl
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
iPhone<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable <span class="org-sh-escaped-newline">\</span>
      pkgsCross.iphone64.haskell.packages.jq
</pre>
</div></li>
</ol>

<p>
Notice that the pkgsCross attribute is just sugar to a more powerful &amp;
composable interface to Nixpkgs. This can be specified from the
command line with,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable <span class="org-sh-escaped-newline">\</span>
      --arg crossSystem <span class="org-string">'{ config = "&lt;arch&gt;-&lt;vendor&gt;-&lt;kernel&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;"; }'</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For instance you may want to cross-compile Firefox for ARM64 Linux.
This is as easy as<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix build -f channel:nixos-unstable <span class="org-sh-escaped-newline">\</span>
      --arg crossSystem <span class="org-string">'{ config = "arm64-unknown-linux-gnu"; }'</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can be much more specific with what you want through crossSystem.
Many more combinations are possible, but they all revolve around that
four-part string config listed. It corresponds to
<code>&lt;arch&gt;-&lt;vendor&gt;-&lt;kernel&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;</code> and is commonly called the
LLVM triple<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>. The LLVM triple has become the standard way to
specify systems across many free software toolchains including GCC,
Binutils, Clang, libffi, etc. There is more information that can be
specified in <code>crossSystem</code> &amp; <code>localSystem</code> within Nixpkgs but this is
not covered here as they are heavily dependent on the specific
toolchain being used.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfb1abb7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgfb1abb7"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> When things break</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
While the fundamentals of cross compiling in Nixpkgs are very good,
individual packages will sometimes be broken. This is sometime because
the package definition in Nixpkgs is incorrect. There are some common
mistakes that occur that I want to cover here. First, the difference
between ‘build-time’ vs ‘runtime’ dependencies<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>build-time dependencies: tools that will be run on the computer
doing the cross compiling</li>
<li>runtime dependencies: libraries and tools that will run on the
computer we are targeting.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In Nixpkgs, build-time dependencies should be put in
<code>nativeBuildInputs</code>. Runtime dependencies should be put in
<code>buildInputs</code>. Currently, this distinction has no effect on native
compilation but it is crucial for correct cross-compilation. There are
proposals to Nixpkgs to enforce the use of <code>buildInputs</code> as
<code>nativeBuildInputs</code> even on native builds but this is yet to be agreed
on<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes your package will pull in a dependency indirectly so that
dependency is not listed in <code>buildInputs</code> or <code>nativeBuildInputs</code>. This
breaks the package splicing that goes on behind the scenes to make
pick up the package set to get each package. To fix it, you will have
to splice the package yourself. This is fairly straightforward. For
examples, let’s say that your package depends on the <code>pkgs.git</code> git
executable to be available through the <code>GIT_CMD</code> variable, which means
it is not listed in <code>nativeBuildInputs</code>. In this case, you should
instead refer to <code>git</code> as <code>pkgs.buildPackages.git</code>. This will pick up
the build package set instead of the target package set.
</p>

<p>
There are a few more things that can go wrong within Nixpkgs. If you
need to conditionally do something only when cross compiling (say a
configure flag like <code>--enable-cross-compilation</code>), you should use
<code>stdenv.hostPlatform != stdenv.buildPlatform</code>. If you want to check,
for instance, that the platform you are building for is a Windows
computer, just use <code>stdenv.hostPlatform.isWindows</code>, in the same way
that you can also check for Linux with <code>stdenv.hostPlatform.isLinux</code>.
These cases are often necessary, but remember they should only be used
when absolutely needed. The more code we share between platforms, the
more code is tested.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes packages are just not written in a cross-friendly way. This
will usually happen just because the software author has not thought
of how to handle cross compilation<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>. We want to work with
software authors to make this process easier &amp; contribute to the
portability of free software. This takes time but we are definitely
making progress. Contributions are always encouraged to <a href="https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/">the Nixpkgs
repo</a>.
</p>

  <title>Channel Changing with Nix</title>
  <description><![CDATA[

<div id="outline-container-orge44ee24" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge44ee24"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Introduction to channels</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
One of the many underappreciated feature of Nix is its ability to
travel back in time. Functional dependencies mean that you can easily
pull in old releases of NixOS &amp; Nixpkgs without changing your
environment at all! It’s surprisingly easy in Nix 2.0 with its
support for Import From Derivation.
</p>

<p>
First, I will provide some code to get us started. This Nix script is
what I use as my “channel changer”. It bootstraps the use of old
channels. In Nix-world, channels are just what we call the CI-tested
branch of NixOS/Nixpkgs<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. The NixOS maintainers have been making
releases consistently since 2013, so there is a lot of interesting
history.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgce32985" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgce32985"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Channel changing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Here is my script that I will refer to later on in the post
as “channels.nix” (be sure to try it out yourself!)<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nix"><span class="org-nix-keyword">let</span> <span class="org-nix-attribute">mapAttrs</span> = f: set: <span class="org-nix-builtin">builtins</span>.listToAttrs (
      <span class="org-nix-builtin">map</span> (attr: { <span class="org-nix-attribute">name</span> = attr; <span class="org-nix-attribute">value</span> = f set.${attr}; })
    (<span class="org-nix-builtin">builtins</span>.attrNames set));
    <span class="org-nix-attribute">channels</span> = {
      <span class="org-nix-attribute">aardvark</span>    = <span class="org-string">"13.10"</span>;
      <span class="org-nix-attribute">baboon</span>      = <span class="org-string">"14.04"</span>;
      <span class="org-nix-attribute">caterpillar</span> = <span class="org-string">"14.12"</span>;
      <span class="org-nix-attribute">dingo</span>       = <span class="org-string">"15.09"</span>;

      <span class="org-nix-attribute">flounder</span>    = <span class="org-string">"16.09"</span>;
      <span class="org-nix-attribute">gorilla</span>     = <span class="org-string">"17.03"</span>;
      <span class="org-nix-attribute">hummingbird</span> = <span class="org-string">"17.09"</span>;
      <span class="org-nix-attribute">impala</span>      = <span class="org-string">"18.03"</span>;
    };
<span class="org-nix-keyword">in</span> mapAttrs (v:

   channels
</pre>
</div>

<p>
As you can see from the script there have been 9 releases in total. We
use a different letter of the alphabet for each release, starting with
A for Aardvark. We are now up to I for Impala<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. New releases
happen every 6 months with Aardvark released in December 2013. The
releases are versioned as <code>YY.MM</code> which is a common practice for Linux
distros.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgee2c402" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgee2c402"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> ‘nix run’ magic</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
In my Nix script, I have created an “attribute” for each version that
has been released. With Nix 2.0, it is very easy to run packages from
them. Here is the command to run <code>hello</code> world from Hummingbird.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix hummingbird.hello -c hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
Hello, world!

</pre>

<p>
This has run the <code>hello</code> executable from the hummingbird release.
Since you are most likely not running Hummingbird, it may take a while
to the first time. However, once Nix has downloaded the needed files
future execution will be instantaneous. The package is completely
self-contained! To start, we will do examples in Impala (18.03) so
that things go a little faster.
</p>

<p>
There are lots of packages in Nixpkgs so we don’t have to restrict
ourselves to just hello. Let’s try out cowsay first.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix impala.cowsay -c cowsay hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">

                ||----w |
                ||     ||

<p>
There are many, many more of these commands. I’ve included a few below
for you to try out on your own.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The fact that Nix works so well on macOS is a miracle in its own
right. Apple has a proprietary ABI but Nix is intended to be used with
free software. To get around this, many hacks are necessary including
taking Apple’s standard C library<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>. Anyway, I was interested in how
well the binaries produced by Nixpkgs hold up on my MacBook. For
reference, here are the versions of macOS available when each release
happened. Those familiar with macOS internals will remember some
significant differences between these versions.

<td class="org-left">High Sierra (10.13)</td>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>
So, my MacBook is running the latest macOS 10.13. Naturally we can
test that Impala &amp; Hummingbird will work correctly. <code>hello</code> is a good
tester, of course, not comprehensive.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix impala.hello -c hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
Hello, world!

</pre>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix hummingbird.hello -c hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
Hello, world!

</pre>

<p>
But now let’s test Gorilla. It was released when macOS Sierra was
still around but the ABI should be compatible.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix gorilla.hello -c hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/system/libsystem_coretls.dylib
 Referenced from: /nix/store/v7i520r9c2p8z6vk26n53hfrxgqn8cl9-Libsystem-osx-10.11.6/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
 Reason: image not found
sh: line 1: 23628 Abort trap: 6           nix run -f channels.nix gorilla.hello -c hello

</pre>

<p>
Oh no!
</p>

<p>
We can see that libSystem 10.11 has been downloaded for us<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>.
However, libSystem is referring to an image that isn’t on our machine.
<code>libsystem_coretls.dylib</code> must have existed in 10.11 macOS but been
removed since then<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
At this point, it may look like Nixpkgs will be broken going
backwards. But, I want to try Flounder just to see what happens.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix flounder.hello -c hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
Hello, world!

</pre>

<p>
Amazingly, it worked! I am still not sure what the differences are,
but it seems that the older executable is still available. Let’s try
out Emu to see what happens there.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix emu.hello -c hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
builder for '/nix/store/s41jnb4kmxxbwj40c5l88k9ma0mwfy0b-hello-2.10.drv' failed due to signal 4 (Illegal instruction: 4)
error: build of '/nix/store/s41jnb4kmxxbwj40c5l88k9ma0mwfy0b-hello-2.10.drv' failed

</pre>

<p>
Wow! Again we hit an issue. This is the infamouse <code>Illegal
instruction: 4</code> bug that is frequently hit in Nixpkgs<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>. It occurs
when an executable uses instructions that have been blocked by the XNU
kernel. This is usually because they are considered insecure so a
patch is needed to fix it. We no longer support Emu, so this is
probably the end of the line. Let’s try Dingo out just to be sure
though.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix dingo.hello -c hello

<p>
This is a curious error because it is very different from the previous
one. Back here we were still using Clang 3.3 &amp; it looks like
bootstrapping is failing on our newer machines. I was not using Nix at
this time (late 2015), so I will have to defer to someone who
remembers that time better. Let’s keep going.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix run -f channels.nix caterpillar.hello -c hello
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">

<div class="org-src-container">

</div>

<pre class="example">

</pre>

<p>
I’ve grouped them together because they have the same output. It
appears that <code>hello</code> was not available back then! I’m not sure what is
going on. Again, I will defer to someone else to explain why this
happens. But, I know for a fact that GNU Hello is one of the first
packages to be packaged in the Nix language<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>.

I wanted to also look at what happens on Linux when you go back
through channels. I don’t have time currently so I am just including
what I have. Anyway, if you are able to report back what happens on
Linux when running these old channels, it would certainly be
interesting.
</p>

<p>
My main goal was to just share some useful things in Nix that I don’t
think many people outside of the core Nix community know about.
Documentation has gotten better recently but lots of times people like
to just read blog posts like this. Hopefully you got a feel for what
can be done in Nix.

  <title>66% of Nixpkgs are up-to-date</title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Just wanted to congratulate everyone for all of the work in keeping
Nixpkgs up-to-date!
</p>

<p>
Repology has just updated our stats and we have shown significant
improvement. 66% of nixpkgs-unstable packages are up-to-date, with a
total of 6112 up-to-date packages<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. Nixpkgs is slowly growing to
match package sets that come in many of the big Linux distros. We now
have more up-to-date packages than rolling release distros Arch (5924)
and Manjaro (5708)! We certainly have a ways to go to compete with
heavyweights like FreeBSD Ports (15410), DragonFly BSD Ports (14268),
and Debian (14915) but these are ancient projects that have had a huge
headstart. We are definitely making progress and it’s visible in the
Repology graphs<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
For comparison, in February, nixpkgs-unstable had 60% of packages
up-to-date, with a total of 5439 up-to-date packages<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. This kind
of progress over 1 month is tremendously helpful. Remember that most
of these updates will be included in 18.09, not the soon to be release
18.03. This protects users from potentially breaking changes as well
as giving maintainers plenty of time to verify that the updates have
not had any negative effects.
</p>

<p>
Ryan Mulligan’s <a href="https://github.com/ryantm/nix-update">nix-update</a> has made updating packages much easier and
I think it will be a game changer for Nixpkgs in the long run. There
are still some kinks in it but I think it is slowly getting better. It
has certainly been a headache to handle the huge increase in pull
requests, but we are slowly clearing through that glut of outdated
software. If an update to nixpkgs-unstable breaks something for you,
please be sure to open an issue.

  <title>nix-buffer: nix-shell in Emacs</title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Shea Levy has a wonderful package out for users of Nix and Emacs. It’s
called <a href="https://github.com/shlevy/nix-buffer">nix-buffer</a> and it greatly improves working on Nix stuff in
Emacs. To try it just get it from MELPA by running <code>M-x
package-install&lt;RET&gt;nix-buffer</code>.
</p>

<p>
To use it in a project you need to create a new file in your project
directory called <code>dir-locals.nix</code>. It works a lot like
<code>.dir-locals.el</code> but it allows you to evaluate Nix expressions.
</p>

<p>
To setup, just create <code>dir-locals.nix</code> that looks like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nix"><span class="org-nix-keyword">let</span> <span class="org-nix-attribute">pkgs</span> = <span class="org-nix-builtin">import</span> <span class="org-nix-constant">&lt;nixpkgs&gt;</span> {};
<span class="org-nix-keyword">in</span> <span class="org-nix-keyword">with</span> pkgs; nixBufferBuilders.withPackages [ &#8230; ]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can put anything from Nixpkgs inside of <code>withPackages</code>. That path
is added to your exec-path in Emacs. Using this you can wrap your
project in a container and avoid conflicts between project configurations!
</p>

<p>
There’s lot of future extensions for this. Ideally we could skip and
the <code>dir-locals.nix</code> configuration and automatically detect what
dependencies you need based on your <code>default.nix</code> file.
</p>

  <title>Why Nix?</title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
<b>THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS ESSAY</b>
</p>

<p>
To someone new to it, Nix may not stand out as a package manager. We’re all used
to how the average package manager works. You expect it to be able to install
and uninstall apps and services and then mostly get out of the way. With that in
mind, you look for ease-of-use, community support, and number of packages in
your package manager. These are all important in any package manager and Nix
compares well in some of these metrics<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. But just looking at this, you’ll
miss what makes Nix useful.
</p>

<p>
Nix isn’t just a package manager. It’s a functional programming language that
just happens to also be a really good package manager. At first, it might not
make sense to have a programming language just for your package manager. The Nix
model of package management takes some getting used to.
</p>

<p>
Packages are represented in Nix as a special data type called a derivation. The
name <b>derivation</b> comes from the idea that each package is <i>derived</i> from some
inputs like source code, libraries, and build tools<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. Each derivation has
its own directory, unique to every unique derivation written in code.
</p>

<p>
Together, these ideas make Nix really useful. To demonstrate its usefulness,
I’ve outlined three points where Nix is much better than an ordinary package
manager. There are many others<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> but these are the ones that I think are
most convincing.

  <title>Reproducible résumés</title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Recently, ‘reproducible’ papers have appeared in Academia. The idea is to make
all of a paper’s data and code openly available so that readers can reproduce
its findings. For software-heavy papers, it makes perfect sense to include code
in papers because the code is often as important as the paper’s text.
</p>

<p>
Outside of Academia, there’s not as much interest in this idea of
<i>reproducibility</i>. That’s unfortunate because it’s a really neat idea.
</p>

<p>
To make this idea more accessible for those outside Academia, I’m going to
introduce a new kind of reproducibility. Everyone in the working world needs to
apply for a job at some point. So, let’s figure out how to make a résumé,
reproducible. This document will be all that is needed to generate my résumé.
With some minor adjustments you can use it to generate your own.
</p>

<p>
At the end of this guide, you should have all of the information needed produce
a PDF version of your résume.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4af424f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4af424f"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> The Résumé</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
LaTeX makes it very easy to generate Résumés. It provides extremely powerful
typesetting features and can output PDF. Some of the syntax is scary to the
unexperienced but I’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible.
</p>

<p>
LaTeX syntax can be a little confuging at first but basically everything is
made up of <b>commands</b>. Each command starts with a <code>\</code> followed by a command
name. Each command can take a variable number of arguments and they are
specified with <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>. LaTeX is made up a series of packages that provide

Every LaTeX document has a document class. Think of it like the CSS to the
Résumé’s HTML. Classes tells LaTeX how to layout the document and there are a
few builtin ones like ‘article’ that work fairly well for basic document.
I’ve built up my own class that works well for résumés. It’s largely based
off of @posquit0’s Awesome-CV but with some minor adjustments to make it a
little cleaner. In addition, I’ve followed some of Matthew Butterick’s guide
on résumés. You can read about them at <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/resumes.html">Practical Typography</a>.
</p>

<p>
I’ve make it available at <a href="./resume.cls">resume.cls</a> of this repo’s root but I won’t include
it in this blog post (but it’s still in the <a href="./README.html">./README.html</a> file).

<p>
Every LaTeX document has a document class. For this document, I will use a
custom <b>resume</b> class.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-latex"><span class="org-font-latex-sedate"><span class="org-keyword">\documentclass</span></span>[<span class="org-variable-name">11pt</span>]{<span class="org-function-name">resume</span>}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Next, I’ll provide some semantic information. Each of these commands is
defined in the résumé class. You can make your own commands but I’ve tried to
make this document as simple as possible.
</p>

<p>
All of the following elements correspond to my name, address, mobile, email
and homepage. The contents are not parsed by LaTeX so you could put anything
here, but you should aim to make each command as semantic as possible.
</p>

<p>
My personal info follows,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-latex"><span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\name</span>{Matthew}{Bauer}

<span class="org-font-latex-sedate">\homepage</span>{www.matthewbauer.us}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This begins the document. The command <code>makecvheader</code> is from resume.cls and
will setup the basic template.
</p>

Everything that follows is my own résume, but the ideas should be fairly self-explanatory.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
This LaTeX class defines <code>\cvsection</code> to separate sections of the résumé by a
horizontal line and some blank space. The only argument for <code>\cvsection</code> sets
the contents of the section header.
</p>

<p>
I start my résume with the ‘Eduction’ section.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
<code>cventry</code> can be though of as a function that takes a variable 5 arguments.
The first will be the heading used. The second will be on the right-hand side
in <i>italics</i>. The third will be in <i>italics</i> immediately below the first. The
fourth will be on the right-hand side of the third argument. The last argument
provides items for the entry.
</p>

<p>
For my résumé, I have chosen to use each of these arguments for certain
purposes. It’s not necessary to do the same, but you should use a consistent
style throughout your résumé.

Nix makes it possible to make this Résumé truly reproducible. Nix is a purely
functional package manager. This means that each package is defined in a
functional language and we have much more powerful tools at our disposal.
</p>

<p>
Nix can be installed on both Linux and macOS machines. It is fairly easy to
setup, provided you have <b>sudo</b> access. Run the following and follow some
simple steps to get Nix working,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
</pre>
</div>

<p>
More information on Nix is available from the <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/">Nix homepage</a>. On <a href="#org8eca2ce">the next page</a>, I’ll explain
how build this résumé using Nix.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8eca2ce" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8eca2ce"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> <code>resume.nix</code></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
To start, we’ll this need to pull in Nixpkgs. Nixpkgs provides a set of
packages for Nix to use. Because Nix is functional, we’ll make nixpkgs an
optional argument if we ever want to work with multiple package set versions.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nix">{nixpkgs ? <span class="org-nix-constant">&lt;nixpkgs&gt;</span>}: <span class="org-nix-keyword">with</span> <span class="org-nix-builtin">import</span> nixpkgs {};
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This syntax may be a little hard to understand for users new to Nix. <code>{}:</code>
declares a function. This particular function will take up the entire file and
Nix will <code>autocall</code> it when no arguments are necessary. This particular
function has one arguments, nixpkgs, that refers to the package set being
used. To make things easier we provide a default after the <code>?</code> symbol.
<code>&lt;nixpkgs&gt;</code> refers to the nixpkgs channels that the user has setup. It can be
updated with,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix-channel --update
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Giving us a potentially newer version of Nixpkgs and its software to work
with.
</p>

<p>
Almost everything in Nix is a derivation (including Nix itself). Each
derivation has its own store path so we can reference it through
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nix">stdenv.mkDerivation {
  <span class="org-nix-attribute">name</span> = <span class="org-string">"resume"</span>;
  <span class="org-nix-attribute">src</span> = <span class="org-nix-constant">./.</span>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We’ll name this derivation resume and tell it to use the files in the current
directory as source.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nix"><span class="org-nix-attribute">buildInputs</span> = [
  (texlive.combine {
    <span class="org-nix-keyword">inherit</span> (texlive) scheme-basic xetex xetex-def setspace fontspec
          chktex enumitem xifthen ifmtarg filehook

          trimspaces parskip hyperref url euenc
          collection-fontsrecommended;
  })
];
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Inputs in Nix are similar to dependencies in other package managers. Here, we
list only one dependency which provides our LaTeX distribution.
<code>texlive.combine</code> is a function that produces a derivation which will provide
the <code>xetex</code> binary. Each attribute listed in between <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> will be
passed as LaTeX packages to TeX Live. The <code>inherit</code> keyword tells Nix to pass
everything after <code>(texlive)</code> as attributes of <code>texlive</code> to <code>texlive.combine</code>.
Each one of those names listed should correspond to TeX Live packages that are
needed to build the résumé PDF.
</p>

<p>
In the future, I’d like to get Tex Live to actually recognize the packages we
are using within LaTeX, but nothing seems to exist to do this.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nix"><span class="org-nix-attribute">buildPhase</span> = <span class="org-string">''</span>
<span class="org-string">  xelatex -file-line-error -interaction=nonstopmode resume.tex</span>
<span class="org-string">''</span>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here we actually build the <code>xelatex</code> file. These options make it easier to
debug <code>xelatex</code> when something goes wrong and makes sure we don’t get
<code>xelatex</code> doesn’t require any user input. It will produce a file called
<code>resume.pdf</code> that we can use as a résumé.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nix"><span class="org-nix-attribute">installPhase</span> = <span class="org-string">''</span>
<span class="org-string">  cp resume.pdf $out</span>
<span class="org-string">''</span>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Finally, we copy this résumé to <code>$out</code> where the derivation will live.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
This entire document is built with ~org-mode~’s Babel engine. This means that
we can generate the files needed to build the résumé from scratch. To do
this, first we must clone this repository (if you haven’t already).
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">git clone https://github.com/matthewbauer/resume
<span class="org-builtin">cd</span> resume
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Next, we need to open this file in Emacs and generate the files (<i>tangle</i> it
in Babel lingo). Run this now, if you haven’t already,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">emacs README.org
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Finally, let’s build these files. From Emacs, type the following: <code>C-c C-v t</code>
(org-babel-tangle). This will take a little bit, but at the end of it you will
have all of the files <i>tangled</i> inside README.org. You can build the résumé
with,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix-build resume.nix

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Sadly, Nix does not understand raw Org mode (yet). We need a bootstrap to
generate a Nix script from this file to truly automate this. I’ve included it
here for completeness, but you’ll need to generate it first before Nix will
work. If you haven’t already, generate this in <code>org-mode</code> by moving the cursor
into the src block below and pressing <code>C-u C-c C-v t</code> (org-babel-tangle).
Alternatively, I’ve provided a pregenerated file at <a href="./default.nix">./default.nix</a>.

<div class="org-src-container">

<span class="org-nix-keyword">let</span>

</div>

<p>
Again, we’re be defining a function. Now, we will be using the let&#x2026;in
syntax to define a derivation to use.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nix"><span class="org-nix-attribute">README</span> = stdenv.mkDerivation {
  <span class="org-nix-attribute">name</span> = <span class="org-string">"README"</span>;
  <span class="org-nix-attribute">unpackPhase</span> = <span class="org-string">"true"</span>;
  <span class="org-nix-attribute">buildInputs</span> = [ emacs ];
  <span class="org-nix-attribute">installPhase</span> = <span class="org-string">''</span>
<span class="org-string">    mkdir -p $out</span>
<span class="org-string">    cd $out</span>
<span class="org-string">    cp -r </span><span class="org-nix-antiquote">${</span><span class="org-nix-constant">./fonts</span><span class="org-nix-antiquote">}</span><span class="org-string"> fonts</span>
<span class="org-string">    cp </span><span class="org-nix-antiquote">${</span><span class="org-nix-constant">./README.org</span><span class="org-nix-antiquote">}</span><span class="org-string"> README.org</span>
<span class="org-string">    emacs --batch -l ob-tangle --eval "(org-babel-tangle-file \"README.org\")"</span>
<span class="org-string">    cp resume.nix default.nix</span>
<span class="org-string">  ''</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The README derivation builds all of the things contained within this
README.org file. Almost every code block here will make a file that we’ll feed
into Nix. Fonts are external to the README because they are binary and cannot
be put in an Org file, but you can view them in <a href="./fonts">./fonts</a>.
</p>

<p>
Now, we’ll create another derivation with Nix. This will utilize a little
known feature of Nix called IFD.
It might not make sense right now, but it runs the <code>README</code> derivation’s
<code>resume.nix</code> file as its own Nix expression.
</p>

<p>
<i>IFD</i> stands for Import From Derivation. Basically, it means we can import
data generated in one derivation, <code>README</code>, in Nix to generate another
derivation. This will bootstrap the <a href="./README.html">./README.html</a> and allow us to avoid
generated files.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nix"><span class="org-nix-keyword">in</span> <span class="org-nix-builtin">import</span> README {<span class="org-nix-keyword">inherit</span> nixpkgs;}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This can be thought of as a recursive call to Nix. It basically lets us use
the Nix output of README.org as an input for Nix. The derivation will produce
a <code>./result</code> file that will contain the output of <code>build.nix</code> for the Building
it section.
</p>

<p>
Now, we can finally build the Résumé! To do this, we just need to run
<code>nix-build</code> from the command line.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">nix-build
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Look at <code>./result</code> and it will be PDF file you can open.

Travis supports Nix projects out-of-the-box so all that’s really needed is
the above. However, matrices are useful to make sure it runs on more than one
machine and accross different versions.

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-yaml"><span class="org-variable-name">script</span>: nix-build --arg nixpkgs <span class="org-string">"builtins.fetchTarball \"$NIXPKGS\""</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This line tells Travis what to build. The <code>$NIXPKGS</code> variable should become
clear after reading the usage below.
</p>

<p>
We want to target Linux and macOS. This will make sure the build script is
portable. Unfortunately, Nix does not support Windows systems and Travis does
not support any BSDs.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-yaml"><span class="org-variable-name">os</span>:
  - linux
  - osx
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Each value of <code>NIXPKGS</code> corresponds to a tarball release of Nixpkgs. This
means that we can avoid problems that arise when the Nixpkgs repo is broken.
Any URL to a tarball with a Nixpkgs set will work, but in Nix we call these
‘channels’. Each channel has a set of tests that are required to run before a
new release of the channel. You could actually point directly to Nixpkgs HEAD
using <a href="https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/archive/master.tar.gz">GitHub’s archive URL</a> but this would constantly break as you would
frequently have to rebuild whole packages when you could just let Hydra do it
for you. You can find a whole listing at <a href="https://nixos.org/channels">NixOS.org</a> but I have included
the most recent channels below.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-yaml"><span class="org-variable-name">env</span>:
  - NIXPKGS=nixos.org/channels/nixos-17.09/nixexprs.tar.xz
  - NIXPKGS=nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-17.09-darwin/nixexprs.tar.xz
  - NIXPKGS=nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable/nixexprs.tar.xz
  - NIXPKGS=nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable/nixexprs.tar.xz
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Travis works with ‘matrices’ meaning that every attribute of one property
(os) will get crossed with another property (env). We need to modify some of
these to get a working matrix.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-yaml"><span class="org-variable-name">matrix</span>:
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We exclude some (os, env) pairs here. It doesn’t really make sense to use a
Darwin channel on Linux or a NixOS channel on macOS.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-yaml"><span class="org-variable-name">exclude</span>:
  - <span class="org-variable-name">os</span>: linux
    <span class="org-variable-name">env</span>: NIXPKGS=nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-17.09-darwin/nixexprs.tar.xz

    <span class="org-variable-name">env</span>: NIXPKGS=nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable/nixexprs.tar.xz
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We allow some failure for unstable branches. We don’t expect stable releases
to always work.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-yaml"><span class="org-variable-name">allow_failures</span>:
  - <span class="org-variable-name">env</span>: NIXPKGS=nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable/nixexprs.tar.xz
  - <span class="org-variable-name">env</span>: NIXPKGS=nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable/nixexprs.tar.xz
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This will end up building five résumés three on Linux machines and two on
macOS machines. So, using <a href="./.travis.yml">./.travis.yml</a>, you can make Travis automatically
build a <code>resume.pdf</code> every time you commit a change. You should be able to
set this up yourself but alternatively you can look at <a href="https://travis-ci.org/matthewbauer/resume">my Travis dashboard</a>.

More information on reproducible research is available at <a href="https://reproducibleresearch.net">Reproducible
Research</a>. My hope is that eventually more things will become ‘reproducible’.
Technologies like Nix and Babel make this fairly easy but they have not yet
entered into the average Software Developer’s toolbelt. Reproducible projects
may take longer to setup, but they lead to more robust software systems.
</p>

<p>
Résumé require a careful mix of informative content and flashy styling. Too
much information and employers will be overwhelmed but too little and
employers assume you are inexperienced. Likewise, . Perhaps eventually,
software companies will read through résumés in org-mode instead of PDFs, but
alas Silicon Valley has not yet reached this level of Nirvana.
</p>

<p>
I welcome everyone to fork <a href="https://github.com/matthewbauer/resume">the repo</a> containing these files. You should be able
to generate your own Résumé by modifying the contents of Semantic info and
LaTeX document. Any contributions to the process of reproducible résumés are
welcome and you can open them as issues under that GitHub repo. Alternatively,
you can email me at <a href="mailto:mjbauer95@gmail.com">mjbauer95@gmail.com</a>.

  <title>bauer: an Emacs+Nix IDE</title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
<b>Note: the updated version of this is available at <a href="https://matthewbauer.us/bauer/">https://matthewbauer.us/bauer/</a></b>
</p>

<p>
I’m publishing my IDE as a blog post. It’s all written in Org Babel.
</p>

<p>
This file generates an Emacs configuration. It can be considered an ‘<a href="https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/">Emacs</a>+<a href="https://nixos.org">Nix</a>’
IDE. That is, the Emacs configuration is <i>integrated</i> with hardcoded Nix store
paths. This provides a kind of functional Emacs configuration.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org95288dc" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org95288dc">Usage</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org95288dc">
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5ce3b0d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5ce3b0d">Demo</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5ce3b0d">
<p>
If you already have Nix installed, you can demo this out really easily. Just
run the following,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh"><span class="org-variable-name">url</span>=<span class="org-string">"github.com/matthewbauer/bauer/archive/master.tar.gz"</span> <span class="org-sh-escaped-newline">\</span>
<span class="org-variable-name">expr</span>=<span class="org-string">'import (builtins.fetchTarball "$url")'</span> <span class="org-sh-escaped-newline">\</span>
   nix-shell -p nix-bundle --run <span class="org-string">'nix-run "$expr"'</span>
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb1358cb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb1358cb">Installing/upgrading</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb1358cb">
<p>
Run this from your shell:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">curl https://matthewbauer.us/bootstrap.sh | sh
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Alternatively, you can accomplish the same thing from Emacs by downloading
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewbauer/bauer/master/lisp/installer.el">installer.el</a>, loading it (<code>M‑x load‑file&lt;RET&gt;</code>) and running ‘install’
(<code>M‑x install&lt;RET&gt;</code>). This process will take a little bit as everything is
downloaded. After you restart Emacs, everything should be working.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga9ea64d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga9ea64d">Developing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga9ea64d">
<p>
To make changes to the IDE, it is recommended you setup your environment like
so,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">git clone https://github.com/matthewbauer/bauer ~/bauer
<span class="org-builtin">cd</span> ~/bauer
nix-build
./result/run
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The last line will spawn an Emacs frame in the Git repo. Make any changes you
want to <a href="./README.html">this document</a> or any of the files in <a href="./lisp">the list folder</a>. Make sure you
commit your changes afterward by typing <code>C-c p v</code>, then <code>c-ac</code> (using Magit,
of course). If you have forked this repo on GitHub, you can add it by typing
<code>Mg</code> then your GitHub username within Magit. To push to it, just type <code>Pr</code>
then find your username in the list and press enter. Pull requests are
welcome through GitHub!
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org12d5e6e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="nonix"><a id="org12d5e6e"></a>w/o Nix usage</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nonix">
<p>
You can use <code>bauer</code> without Nix. This just gives you the unintegrated Emacs
configuration. To get started, run the following.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/matthewbauer/bauer ~/.emacs.d/bauer

Then, add the following to <a href="file:///Users/mbauer/.emacs.d/init.el">your Emacs init file</a>,

<a href="./lisp/set-defaults.el">set-defaults</a> provides an easy way to override the default custom files. This
means that when you customize a variable it will appear as ‘standard’ even
though it’s not what the package originally defined as the default. This is
useful for an Emacs distribution to provide <i>better defaults</i> while still
letting the user override them. Look through the lispdoc of the package for
documentation on how this works. Eventually, this will be added to MELPA for
use in other Emacs distributions.

Now, pull in generated paths from <code>site-paths.el</code>. Nix will generate this
file automatically for us and different Emacs variables will be set to their
Nix store derivations. Everything should work fine if you don’t have this
available, though. If you are in Emacs and already have the IDE install you
can inspect this file by typing <code>M-: (find-file (locate-library
   "site-paths"))</code>. It will look similar to a <code>settings.el</code> file where each line
corresponds to a customizable variable. Unlike <code>settings.el</code>, each entry is
path in the Nix store and we verify it exists before setting it.

<h3 id="org09f1d68">Setup use-package</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org09f1d68">
<p>
Now to get <code>use-package</code> we will require package.el and initialize it if
site-paths is not setup (meaning we’re outside the Nix expression). Because
site-paths should be available (unless you don’t have Nix), we can skip this
step. All of this is marked ‘eval-and-compile’ to make sure the compiler
picks it up on build phase.
</p>

<p>
So, there are basically two modes for using this configuration. One when
packages are installed externally (through Nix) and another where they are
installed internally. This is captured in the variable ‘needs-package-init’
which will be t when we want to use the builtin package.el and will be nli
when we want to just assume everything is available.

Alphabetical listing of all Emacs packages needed by the IDE.
</p>

<p>
Rules: No packages on the top level should have the :demand keyword. Each
package should be setup as either commands, hooks, modes, or key bindings.
Defer timers are allowed but should be used sparingly. Currently, these
packages need defer timers:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>autorevert (1)</li>
<li>company (2)</li>
<li>delsel (2)</li>
<li>dtrt-indent (3)</li>
<li>flycheck (3)</li>
<li>savehist (4)</li>
<li>save-place (5)</li>
<li>which-key (3)</li>
<li><p>
apropostriate (2)
</p>

<p>
To resort, go to one of the package group headings and type C-c ^ (the
shortcut for org-sort).

  <title>Nix and Org</title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
This is a guide on getting Org to work with Nix. Specifically, I want to show
how you can write Nix expressions within an Org document. This might not seem
useful at first, but I think by the end of this guide it will become clear how
powerful the combination of these tools are. First, some background on what
these tools are for those unfamiliar.
</p>

<p>
Org was started in 2003 as an extension, or ‘mode’, to the Emacs text editor.
Carsten Dominik, frustrated with Emacs builtin outliner, sought to create
something that he could use to organize all of his notes and projects in a tree
structure. Since then, Org has grown to include features for note-taking,
hyperlinking, todo lists, spreadsheets, literate programming, and even exporting
to HTML and LaTeX (in fact, this blog is composed in Org). It is the <b>literate
programming</b> feature, called <i>Babel</i>, that will be used extensively in this
guide. All of Org’s features are written in extensible Lisp that manipulate
plain-text ‘.org’ files. Carsten’s creation has become extremely popular among
Emacs users and since 2007 has been included in Emacs. The easiest way to start
using Org is to download Emacs directly from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">the GNU website</a>.
</p>

<p>
Let’s start by creating a new Org file. Once you have Emacs started, you can
create a new file by pressing <code>C‑x C‑f</code>. If you are unfamiliar with this
notation, that means press and hold the Control key, then press x, then press f.
Now we can name the new file at the ‘Find file: ’ prompt. Let’s type ‘demo.org’
here and then press enter. Now we have an empty Org mode file to type into. You
can save it at any time with <code>C‑x C‑s</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org"><span class="org-org-document-info-keyword">#+title:</span> <span class="org-org-document-title">Org Demo</span>
<span class="org-org-document-info-keyword">#+date:</span> <span class="org-org-document-info">&lt;2017-10-15 Sun&gt;</span>

This is just a plain-text document. Keep this document open because we&#8217;ll be
editing this file throughout the tutorial.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now that you have an Org file setup, make sure you leave Emacs open and we’ll
refer back to this file later. Next, some background on Nix.
</p>

<p>
Nix was started in 2004 as a <i>purely functional package manager</i>. It solves many
problems in traditional package management. For instance, multiple versions of a
package can be used at the same time, each package gets unique dependencies, bad
upgrades can be rolled back, and unused packages can be garbage collected. More
information on Nix is available from the <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/">Nix homepage</a>. Nix can be installed on
both Linux and macOS machines. It is fairly easy to setup, provided you have
<b>sudo</b> access. Run the following in a terminal to install Nix,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once Nix has been installed, we can go back to Emacs and start writing to
<code>demo.org</code>. Let’s append some documentation to the Org file on what we’ll be building.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">
This Org file builds the Nix expression for &#8216;Hello World&#8217;.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To put source code in our Org file, we’ll need to know some Org syntax. The
directives <code>#+begin_src</code> and <code>#+end_src</code> tell Org that we are writing in another
language. <b>nix</b> is the name of the language and <code>hello.nix</code> is the file that Org
will write (tangle) the code to.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">
#+begin_src nix :tangle hello.nix
<span class="org-italic">/* Nix code goes here */</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Finally, we can write in Nix’s expression language to create a Hello World
package. Nix’s syntax can be confusing to new users so I’ll be as verbose as
possible. Almost everything is a function in Nix, so, let’s define some
arguments for a <i>Hello World</i> function. Functions with multiple arguments are
defined with <code>{ a, b, c }:</code> where each argument is a comma separated identifier
between <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>. We’ll need <code>stdenv</code> (Nix’s standard environment) and
<code>fetchurl</code> (Nix’s function to download a URL) to build Hello World.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">{ stdenv, fetchurl }:
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Next, we need to provide a definition for Hello World. We want to build Hello
World from some source files. That’s called a derivation in Nix and we can
accomplish it by calling the <code>stdenv.mkDerivation</code> function. The keyword <code>rec</code>
tells Nix that our arguments to <code>stdenv.mkDerivation</code> might be recursive,
meaning our args might need to reference each other.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Let’s give this derivation a name.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">name = "hello-2.10";
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then provide a source using fetchurl.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">  src = fetchurl {
    url = "mirror://gnu/hello/${name}.tar.gz";
    sha256 = "0ssi1wpaf7plaswqqjwigppsg5fyh99vdlb9kzl7c9lng89ndq1i";
  };
}
<span class="org-org-meta-line">#+end_src</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That’s it! We’ve defined a Nix expression that will build Hello World.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, this won’t work on it’s own because Nix doesn’t know what stdenv
and fetchurl refer to. We’ll need to define another Nix expression to bootstrap
this one. Since this is all in Org mode that’s as easy as just adding another
code block. We’ll call it <code>bootstrap.nix</code> and it will just call <code>hello.nix</code> as a
package using the <code>stdenv</code> and <code>fetchurl</code> defined in <a href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/">Nixpkgs</a>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">
<span class="org-org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src nix :tangle bootstrap.nix</span>
<span class="org-org-block">{ nixpkgs ? </span><span class="org-org-block"><span class="org-nix-constant">&lt;nixpkgs&gt;</span></span><span class="org-org-block"> }:</span>

<span class="org-org-block"><span class="org-nix-keyword">with</span></span><span class="org-org-block"> </span><span class="org-org-block"><span class="org-nix-builtin">import</span></span><span class="org-org-block"> nixpkgs {};</span>

<span class="org-org-block">callPackage </span><span class="org-org-block"><span class="org-nix-constant">./hello.nix</span></span><span class="org-org-block"> {}</span>
<span class="org-org-block-end-line">#+end_src</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Let’s see if this works. Type <code>M‑x</code> (which means hold down the meta key and
press x) and then type <code>org‑babel‑tangle‑file</code> followed by enter. After this was
run, you’ll have a file called <code>hello.nix</code> and a file called <code>bootstrap.nix</code> in
the current directory. Open up a terminal and we can build Hello World.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix-build
/nix/store/&#8230;-hello-2.10
$ ./result/bin/hello
Hello World!
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is pretty useful on its own, but I don’t want to have to <i>tangle</i> the file
each time I make a change. Let’s tangle Org within a Nix expression. Is this
possible in Nix?
</p>

<p>
Recently Nix has added a feature called IFD which stands for <b>Import From
Derivation</b>. It allows us to use generated Nix expressions within another Nix
expression. That way we can derive hello.nix from a Nix expression and then
derive hello.nix, avoiding <code>org‑babel‑tangle‑file</code> completely.
</p>

<p>
To do this, we’ll need to create another Nix file that we’ll call <code>default.nix</code>.
Like the boostraper, I won’t break down exactly what’s going on in this post,
but it follows the basic Import From Derivation process outlined above calling
Org’s tangler.

<p>
We still need to tangle everything one last time. Type <code>M‑x</code> and then type
<code>org‑babel‑tangle‑file</code> followed by enter. A new <code>default.nix</code> file will appear.
That <code>default.nix</code> file along with <code>test.org</code> is all you need to build this
expression. To verify this, let’s first remove those old files so we know they
aren’t being referenced accidentally.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ rm -f hello.nix bootstrap.nix
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Finally, we can build our <i>Hello World</i> expression!
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ nix-build
/nix/store/&#8230;-hello-2.10
$ ./result/bin/hello
Hello World!
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In this guide I’ve shown you an easy way to write Nix expressions in Org. Now
that you have this environment setup, you should try hacking around <code>test.org</code>.
You can always run <code>nix‑build</code> to see if a binary builds. Try using other
sources, creating a new derivation, adding other dependencies, or hack something
else up. I recommend reading through <a href="https://nixos.org/nixos/nix-pills/">the Nix Pills series</a> for learning Nix and
<a href="http://orgmode.org/guide/">the Org Mode Guide</a> for learning Org.
