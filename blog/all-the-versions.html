In <a href="channel-changing.html">Channel Changing with Nix</a>, I described how to move between channels
in Nix expressions. This provides an easy way to work with multiple
versions of Nixpkgs. I was reminded of this post after seeing <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20753066">a
comment</a> by jolmg on Hacker News. The comment suggested we should have
a way to use multiple versions of packages seamlessly together. It
suggested that we should use commits to differentiate versions, but I
suggested that stable <i>channels</i> would work much better.
</p>

<p>
So, as a follow up to my Channel Changing post, I want to show how you
can use a quick Nix mockup to accomplish this. Like the previous post,
it will come with a Nix snippet that you can try out yourself.
</p>

<p>
So, what follows is some code that I wrote up that lets you find
package versions in an easier way. It is also available for download
at <a href="https://matthewbauer.us/generate-versions.nix">https://matthewbauer.us/generate-versions.nix</a>.

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
This Nix expression generates an index of each package from all 11
releases of Nixpkgs that have occurred since October 2010. For every
package, each version that came with a release is included and put
into a map. The map uses the version as a key and the package as its
value, preferring the newer release when versions conflict.
</p>

<p>
This is all done lazily, because that’s how Nix works. Still, it will
take a little while at first to evaluate because we need to parse all
11 releases! Remarkably, this expression uses only Nix builtins, and
requires no special library function.
</p>

<h2 id="org63da916"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Usage</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Working with this Nix expression is extremely interesting, and I’ve
included some examples of how to work with it. They should all be
usable on a Linux machine (or maybe macOS) with <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/">Nix installed</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbce11f0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbce11f0"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Query package versions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
You can query what package versions are available through Nix’s
<code>builtins.attrNames</code> function. For example,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ nix eval <span class="org-string">"(builtins.attrNames (import (builtins.fetchurl https://matthewbauer.us/generate-versions.nix) {}).emacs)"</span>
[ <span class="org-string">"24.3"</span> <span class="org-string">"24.4"</span> <span class="org-string">"24.5"</span> <span class="org-string">"25.3"</span> <span class="org-string">"26.1"</span> ]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This shows us that there are 5 versions of Emacs. This is kind of
interesting because it means that there were at least 6 duplicate
versions of Emacs between our release channels. Unfortunately, a few
versions of Emacs are notably missing including Emacs 25.1 and Emacs
25.2. Emacs 24.2 was released almost a year before the first stable
Nixpkgs release! As time goes on, we should collect more of these
releases.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org01b41f4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org01b41f4"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Running an old version</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
A shown above, there are 5 versions of Emacs available to us. We can
run Emacs 24.3 with a fairly short command:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell"><span class="org-whitespace-line">$ </span><span class="org-variable-name"><span class="org-whitespace-line">LC_ALL</span></span><span class="org-whitespace-line">=C nix run </span><span class="org-string"><span class="org-whitespace-line">"(import (builtins.fetchurl https://matthewbauer.us/generate-versions.nix) {}).emacs.\"24.3\""</span></span><span class="org-whitespace-line"> -c emacs</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>LC_ALL=C</code> is needed on Linux to avoid the old Glibc trying to load
the newer, incompatible locales that may be included with your system.
This is an unfortunate problem with Glibc including breaking changes
between releases. It also makes me want use to switch to Musl some
time soon! I’ve also noticed some incompatibilities with GTK icons
that appear to come from the gdk-pixbuf module. More investigation is
needed on why this is the case.
</p>

<p>
This will not work on macOS because we did not have Emacs
working on macOS back then! macOS users can try Emacs 25.3. This looks
very similar to the above:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ nix run <span class="org-string">"(import (builtins.fetchurl https://matthewbauer.us/generate-versions.nix) {}).emacs.\"25.3\""</span> -c emacs
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org619485c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org619485c"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Firefox</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
Another example using Firefox is pretty neat. The code is very similar
to Emacs:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ nix eval <span class="org-string">"(builtins.attrNames (import (builtins.fetchurl https://matthewbauer.us/generate-versions.nix) {}).firefox)"</span>
[ <span class="org-string">"25.0.1"</span> <span class="org-string">"34.0.5"</span> <span class="org-string">"39.0.3"</span> <span class="org-string">"45.0"</span> <span class="org-string">"48.0.2"</span> <span class="org-string">"51.0.1"</span> <span class="org-string">"55.0.3"</span> <span class="org-string">"59.0.2"</span> <span class="org-string">"63.0.3"</span> <span class="org-string">"66.0.3"</span> <span class="org-string">"68.0.2"</span> ]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We get all 11 releases with unique Firefox versions this time. 
</p>

<p>
You can run Firefox 25.0.1 using this command:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell"><span class="org-whitespace-line">$ </span><span class="org-variable-name"><span class="org-whitespace-line">LC_ALL</span></span><span class="org-whitespace-line">=C nix run </span><span class="org-string"><span class="org-whitespace-line">"(import (builtins.fetchurl https://matthewbauer.us/generate-versions.nix) {}).firefox.\"25.0.1\""</span></span><span class="org-whitespace-line"> -c firefox</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Amazing how notably Firefox has changed since then!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc126eac" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc126eac"><span class="section-number-3">3.4</span> Blender</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
Another example using Blender. The code is very similar to the two above:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ nix eval <span class="org-string">"(builtins.attrNames (import (builtins.fetchurl https://matthewbauer.us/generate-versions.nix) {}).blender)"</span>
[ <span class="org-string">"2.67"</span> <span class="org-string">"2.70"</span> <span class="org-string">"2.72b"</span> <span class="org-string">"2.75a"</span> <span class="org-string">"2.77a"</span> <span class="org-string">"2.78c"</span> <span class="org-string">"2.79"</span> <span class="org-string">"2.79a"</span> <span class="org-string">"2.79b"</span> ]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can run Blender 2.67 using this command:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell"><span class="org-whitespace-line">$ </span><span class="org-variable-name"><span class="org-whitespace-line">LC_ALL</span></span><span class="org-whitespace-line">=C nix run </span><span class="org-string"><span class="org-whitespace-line">"(import (builtins.fetchurl https://matthewbauer.us/generate-versions.nix) {}).blender.\"26.7\""</span></span><span class="org-whitespace-line"> -c blender</span>

<div id="outline-container-orge1a1ad2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge1a1ad2"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Rationale</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The reason that channels work better than commits is because every
commit in Nixpkgs is not guaranteed to work on its own. Some may be
missing security patches, configuration changes, or worse may just not
work with other versions of packages. In addition, there are just too
many commits to work with effectively. On the other hand, Nixpkgs
release stable channels every 6 months, and we have a long vetting
process of ensuring the stabilized channel works well.
</p>

<p>
The main drawback the 6-month channels have is that we don’t have
every version released of package. If the version you want is missing
in a release, you are out of luck. But, the 6-month window tends to
pick up a lot of packages and we end up with almost every major
version of popular software. My philosophy is not all releases are
worth keeping. Some contain critical security flaws, contain major
bugs, and might not work well with other software. The 6-month window
is good enough for me. Perhaps in the future we can increase Nixpkgs
release cadence to 3-month or 1-month, but the maintainers are not
quite ready for that yet.

<h2 id="org6a75fb6"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
This has hopefully shown how Nix’s functional dependency model makes
it very easy to switch between versions of packages. This is builtin
to Nix, but you need some scripts to really use this well. Our 6-month
release window is an arbitrary choice, but tends to pick up a lot of
useful versions in the mean time.
