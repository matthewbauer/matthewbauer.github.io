<p>
Ideally, utilities, such as water, electricity and gas, should be
owned by its customers and not for-profit corporations. That would
mean any money left over at the end of the year are passed on as
future savings to ratepayers. In reality, this is not the case, and
most Americans have at least one utility with for-profit ownership.
</p>

<p>
What’s interesting, however, is that these privately owned utilities
are often publicly traded. So the everyday investor, with enough
money, can actually purchase a chunk of their utilities and simulate
the kind of customer ownership that publicly owned utilities have. The
question is, what’s the right allocation? I’ve been thinking about
this recently, and believe I have a full answer.
</p>

<p>
You want to buy just enough shares of the utility company so that the
profit the company makes off of your usage equals the profit you make
from your stake. If you have any more shares than that, then you’re
taking some profits from other customers. If you have any less (or
zero) shares, then an investor is capturing your profits.
</p>

<p>
So, my allocation formula looks like this:
</p>


<div class="equation-container">
<span class="equation">
<object class="org-svg" aria-label="\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:1}
Your Spending * \frac{Earnings}{Revenue} = Your Shares * \frac{Earnings}{\# Shares}
\end{equation*}
" type="image/svg+xml" data="ltximg/latex7ZWedU_23d14ee262cf6a22471119b3ac72999d0213d230.svg">

</span>
<span class="equation-label">
1
</span>
</div>

<p>
Interestingly, earnings cancels out in this formula, so we don’t
actually need to know about profitability, just revenue. We want just
enough shares so that the revenue taken from us is equal to the
revenue our shares represent. This can further be simplified to:
</p>


<div class="equation-container">
<span class="equation">
<object class="org-svg" aria-label="\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:2}
Your Shares = Your Spending * \frac{\# Shares}{Revenue}
\end{equation*}
" type="image/svg+xml" data="ltximg/latexk8yjXV_19ad564c06042c19f0cfb816455488fec4696c1d.svg">

</span>
<span class="equation-label">

</span>
</div>

<p>
To determine optimal allocation, the two things we will need to
calculate are personal spending and shares per revenue. Personal
spending is not too hard to figure out, but number of shares per
revenue is not a common metric you usually find in prospectuses -
usually number of shares is in the denominator not the numerator. But
there is a related metric we can use for this: Revenue Per Share
(RPS). So the above formula can be rewritten as:
</p>


<div class="equation-container">
<span class="equation">
<object class="org-svg" aria-label="\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:3}
Your Shares = \frac{Your Spending}{Revenue Per Share}
\end{equation*}

Sorry, your browser does not support SVG.</object>
</span>
<span class="equation-label">

</span>
</div>

<p>
Since we cannot predict the future, we have to look backwards at these
two metrics. For my own purposes, I am looking at 2023 numbers, which
will hopefully even out some of the fluctuations in consumption that
happens with seasonal changes.

For this exercise, I’ve looked at my own utilities. I’ve omitted
telephone &amp; cable which I don’t use. I also excluded cellular which is
not quite a monopoly where I am (U.S. cellular networks include AT&amp;T,
Dish, T-Mobile and Verizon).

<p>
For where I live, water and sewer are publicly owned. All other
utilities are owned by investors, and can be bought on the stock
market. Here’s my spending for each of these utilities, as well as:

<p>
Some of this spending is rough estimates. Some percentage of spending
in all of the above goes to sales tax, franchise fees, and other
miscellaneous fees that may not actually reach the utility company.
But, my opinion is a rough estimate is probably okay.

This gives RPS of $23.95/share. According to the above formula, I need
to purchase 57.4 shares of Evergy. As of end of day June 3rd, 2023,
Evergy traded at $52.29/share. So this would require a $3,001.45
investment.
</p>

<p>
Notably, this is looking at the profitability of the whole company.
It’s possible that my specific home is more profitable than the
average Evergy customer. For instance, a big cost for electricity is
getting the power line to the home, which has already been done in my
case. Or maybe some regions are more profitable than others. However,
the same thing I think happens in public utilities - some houses are
cheaper than others, yet the rates stay the same. So, I think looking
at it from a whole company view is both simpler, and closely mirrors
how public utilities actually run in practice.

I’ve saved Google Fiber, now called <a href="https://fiber.google.com">GFiber</a>, for last because I think
it is a special case in this. Alphabet (Google) is a huge company, and
GFiber is only a small part of that. In financial statements, Alphabet
has a broad category called "other bets" which includes GFiber as well
as Waymo, Verily, and X. Other bets as a whole posted losses in the
last couple of years. So most likely Alphabet is not making a profit
on my $70/month I pay for GFiber. As a result, I think it doesn’t make
sense to purchase shares in Alphabet.

<p>
While it may seem like a lot of money, this is actually much cheaper
than I first thought it would cost. Most people don’t have this kind
of money just sitting around, though.
</p>

<p>
Unlike most asset allocations, the percentages will change every year.
For example, increased consumption of natural gas would mean higher
allocation of natural gas. Increased price of natural gas, however,
should be neutral on natural gas’s allocation because while revenue
per share is going up, so is your personal spending.
</p>

<p>
The price of these shares will also change over time, but the allocation is
really based on number of shares, not price. So, any price change
shoudn’t require reallocation, but every time new revenue numbers come
out, you may want to <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Rebalancing">rebalance</a>.

<h2 id="orgfd3a45d"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Open Questions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
What’s the risk to this allocation?
</p>

<p>
I think by purchasing utilities, you are taking on risk that are
held by the shareholders. So, in the event of bankruptcy, your
equity would be wiped out. However, I’m skeptical that public
utilities wouldn’t be bailed out in the event of insolvency. Also,
publicly owned utilities already have this problem - ratepayers (and
maybe also taxpayers) would be on the hook if the utility were
insolvent, so it may not be much worse than that. I haven’t yet
researched any cases of for-profit or pubicly owned utilities
becoming insolvent.
</p></li>

<li><p>
What if you own your utilities through an index fund already?
</p>

<p>
I think you can think of your index fund as a separate pool of money
from your direct ownership of utilities. Index funds are used to
reduce overall risk, while this strategy is intended to capture the
profits from your utility payments.
</p></li>

<li><p>
What if everyone did this?
</p>

<p>
It would be interesting if every ratepayer did this by buying all
the shares of each utility. Would the utility become de facto
publicly owned? Would company management care as much about rates as
profits? All are fascinating questions that I don’t think we can
answer.
</p>

<p>
Another crazy idea: what if publicly owned utilities gave each of
their ratepayers shares: 1 share for $100 in spending. It would let
ratepayers sell their shares if they needed money in return for
higher realized rates rates. But it would be unclear how you would
ensure future ratepayers also get equity. Perhaps it could work
similar to how ESOP programs work in some workplaces.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Don’t state energy regulators represent consumers already?
</p>

<p>
State regulators do have a large role in regulation of energy and
natural gas. They seem to mostly focus on pushing the utilities to
keep rates low. But even the strictist state regulators will
recognize a profit needs to be paid to shareholders each year.
</p></li>

<li><p>
What are some other applications of this?
</p>

<p>
You could take this allocation formula to other applications where
you consume goods. For instance, if you regularly spend $100/month
at Amazon, you could buy ($1200/Amazon RPS) shares in Amazon (where
Amazon’s 2023 RPS is $55.78). This probably doesn’t work for Amazon
in particular since they are a very diverse business and product
sales like Amazon.com is probably less profitable than service sales
like AWS. If you could purchase just the Amazon.com side of the
business, you could perhaps do something like this. It might even be
possible to do it yourself with some clever use of options trading.
Perhaps, a business relying heavily on AWS would want to reap some
of the profits they contribute to. There’s also a risk of being
doubly exposed to risk in Amazon however - both your cloud platform
and your balance sheet are effected if AWS becomes unprofitable.
